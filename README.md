# Bug_Tracker_Analysis
BugTracker_ICT_Analytics

*ICT Bug Tracking & Support Case Study (NOV 2023–JAN 2024)*  
Analysis of ~50,000+ support tickets to identify bottlenecks, workload imbalances, and SLA compliance issues. The project simulates a real ICT Support/Business Analyst environment where tickets are logged, categorized, and resolved across different channels.  

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- Focused on *ticket lifecycle management* and *support performance analytics*.  
- Applied *SQL queries* and *Python analysis* to extract KPIs from ticket logs.  
- Designed visuals and mock dashboards to replicate BA/ICT deliverables.  
- Produced insights for *process improvement, SLA tracking, and resource allocation*.  

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- *Ticket Volumes:* Peaks during product release cycles; consistent weekly traffic.  
- *Priorities:* ~25% marked as high/critical, requiring better triaging.  
- *Resolution Time:* Average ~36 hrs; bottlenecks at “in-progress” stage.  
- *Top Resolvers:* 80% of workload handled by top 10 agents → imbalance in team load.  
- *Channels:* Email dominant → automation opportunities identified.
